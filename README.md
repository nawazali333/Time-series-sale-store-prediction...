# Time-series-sale-store-prediction...

This project aims to analyze and forecast the sales of a store based on the time series data
from Corporation Favorita, a sizable supermarket retailer with headquarters in Ecuador, 
this research seeks to assess the store’s sales.

The objective is to create a model that can properly forecast future sales using the thousands 
of products sold at different Favorita locations, in order to assist the management of the store 
in formulating inventory and sales plans.

We will use sales forecasting to extrapolate future sales levels for a company using historical sales
data because Favorita Corporation’s sales over the past four years have generated a lot of data. Our 
intention is to support business managers in making forecasts about the future based on this information,
which has been kept on file for a set period of time following the event or after it occurred.

As part of this research, we will build models using historical analysis, formulate scientific hypotheses 
based on time-stamped historical data, and then utilize those models to make observations and direct strategic
decision-making in the future. In order to enhance operations and ultimately sales, we would like to assist 
management at Favorita Corporation in gaining some insights from their data.
